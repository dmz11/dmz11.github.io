The Antihydrogen Laser Physics Apparatus (ALPHA) is an experiment based in Switzerland at CERN's Antiproton Decelerator (AD) Hall. By merging ultracold positron and antiproton plasmas, we create and trap hydrogen antiatoms then used for various laser spectroscopy experiments. CPT symmetry is tested through the precise comparison of the atomic spectra of antihydrogen and hydrogen.

ALPHA is the most successful experiment in the world in the creation and study of antihydrogen. The collaboration consists of former members of the ATHENA collaboration, who were the first to produce cold antihydrogen in 2002. ALPHA now holds records for the most antihydrogen ever trapped (over 1000 atoms) and rates of antihydrogen production. ALPHA was the first to measure the 1S-2S transition in addition to the Lyman-Alpha (1S-2P) transition in trapped antihydrogen, as well as the first to demonstrate laser cooling of antihydrogen. ALPHA is now preparing to measure the gravitational interaction of antihydrogen with its new generation trap, coined ALPHAg. Results are expected once antiprotons have been returned to the AD Hall in 2021 after the 2-year shutdown of CERN facilities.
